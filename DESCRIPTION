    )
Description: Facilities to work with vector and raster data in repeatable and systematic workflows. Missing functionality in existing
 packages is included here to allow extraction from rasters with 'simple features' and 'Spatial' types and to make extraction consistent and 
 straightforward. Extract cell numbers from raster data and  return the cells, values and weights as a data frame rather than as lists of 
 matrices or vectors. The functions here allow spatial data to be used without always needing to know the bespoke structures currently in use.
