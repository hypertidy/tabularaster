# tidyraster

Extract cells from rasters and get a nice data frame.

```{r}
library(tidyraster)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
r <- raster(volcano)
p <- rasterToPolygons(r %/% 15, dissolve = TRUE)
x <- cellnumbers(r, p)

x

xweight <- cellnumbers(r, p, weights = TRUE)
xweight  %>% group_by(i_)  %>% summarize(sum(weight))


b <- brick(raster(volcano), raster(volcano * 2))

```
